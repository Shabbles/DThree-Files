I like my burgers with a patty where you can feel the texture of it, with lettuce tomato and that really food melted white cheese to the perfect amount of melt, with a bun that's toasted on the patty side but fluffy on the outside`With a side of fresh cut French fries fried to perfection with just a dab of salt`That, is what I believe to be the best burger
